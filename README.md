## About me
- I am an Electrical & Electronic Engineering Graduate. I received my B.Sc. degree at Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology in 2024.
- My research interest lies in applying machine learning and data science to healthcare, with a focus on bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in developing and integrating data-driven models to analyze and interpret complex biological data. By leveraging advanced data engineering techniques, I aim to translate raw data from clinical trials and healthcare systems into actionable knowledge that can inform personalized medicine and public health strategies.
